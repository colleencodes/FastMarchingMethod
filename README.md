# FastMarchingMethod

Running this code allows one to solve the eikonal equation using the Fast Marching Method (FMM). The eikonal equation shows how information travels from a boundary to an exit set defined in a given domain. FMM uses the idea of front propagation to solve the eikonal equation. Within the FMM, the exit set is defined as well as initial values around the exit set. Then points are discretized starting with the smallest node first.

One can run the eikonal equation in a couple of different setups including a simple experiment starting with the exit set in the middle, or moving it anywhere else inside a square domain. Additionally, the eikonal equation can be solved on a maze, in a spiral, or on a checkerboard. Lastly, you can have the eikonal equation solved at different speeds across the domain.

The final report is above under EikonalEquationFastMarchingMethod.pdf.
